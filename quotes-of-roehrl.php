	In Rally sport it is important that the car has a good handling...
	...you should find a balance between under- and oversteering... with the tendency to drift...
	When accelerating the tears of emotion have to run off horizontally to the ear.
	For me driving starts when I steer the car with the throttle pedal instead of the wheel.
	Good drivers have dead flies on the side windows.
	For everything over 8 minutes I don't wear a helmet. (RÃ¶hrl about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordschleife\">Nordschleife</a>)
	A trained monkey could win with the audi quattro.
	Drifting is the art, holding an instable system stable.
	When you see the tree you crash into you have understeered, when you only hear it you have oversteered.";
